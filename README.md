# 🐍 Python Projects

Welcome to my **Python Projects** repository!  
This is a curated collection of small-to-medium Python projects I built to sharpen my skills and explore different areas of programming.

Each project is standalone and focuses on solving real-world problems or building useful tools — from CLI apps to file automation and simple games.
