# Instagram Downloader 📱

A simple Python tool to download Instagram content with clean, organized folders. Perfect for backing up your favorite creators' posts, stories, and highlights without the clutter of extra files.

## What It Does

This script lets you download Instagram content in a neatly organized way:
- **Posts**: Single images/videos go to a posts folder, while multi-image posts get their own subfolders
- **Stories**: Downloads available stories (login required)
- **Highlights**: Organizes each highlight into its own named folder
- **Clean output**: No messy JSON or metadata files—just your media

## Why I Made This

I wanted a tool that allow me to download full instagram profile media rather than one by one.
